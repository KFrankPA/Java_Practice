/*
1. Create a custom class named Carpet:
                instance variables:
                        width, length, unitPrice, isPersian (boolean)

                Add a constructor that can set all the fields

                instance methods:
                        calcCost(): should be able to caculate the total cost of the carpet and return it as double
                        toString(): should be able to display all the info of the carpet including the total cost of the carpet as calculated by calcCost()

            total price of carpet = (width*length)*unitprice

            if the carpet is persian  carpet, add 200$ to the totalPrice
